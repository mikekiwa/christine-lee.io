            <blockquote>
              <p>My data journey has been a storied path. From an early
              age I was a child torn between two interests: science and music. I
              equally enjoyed learning about space and physics as orchestrial symphonies
              and french horn. Music lured me to pursue a career in orchestral performance
              which continued to be a passion for many years. After spending time
              working in business, I also began to discover an interest in inventory and
              supply chain analysis. </p>
