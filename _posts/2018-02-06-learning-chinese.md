During the first few weeks of 2018 I've been reflecting on the year to come. There are a number of exciting
events in both my profession and my personal life. I've already mentioned starting a master's program where
I'll be learning any number of new concepts and at least a new programming language. However, this post is
about learning a new human language-Chinese. 

Chinese is already an important global langauge. Just the shear number of native speakers is a meaningful 
reason to learn. But the abstracts of a global trade and macroeconomics wasn't _my_ motivation. I started
learning because of the iOS version of [Duolingo]. This app made getting started a joy. 

Chinese is not my first foreign langauge. I studied German for four years and Spanish for one year in 
secondary school. I was exposed to Italian and French when I studied music in undergrad. However, never once
did I attempt to learn
