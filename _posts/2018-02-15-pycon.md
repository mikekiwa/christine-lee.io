Yesterday I registered for [PyCon 2018]. PyCon is _the_ annual conference for everything Python. 
I've been learning and using the language for a few years now but only interact with a few 
people actively using it with any regularity. It should be rewording (and intimidating) to 
meet people in the developer and scientific community who are doing interesting and amazing things
with Python.

For the first time, this event will be held outside of Portland. Cleveland, OH is hosting the event.  
I've never been there so it will be a weekend of firsts.
