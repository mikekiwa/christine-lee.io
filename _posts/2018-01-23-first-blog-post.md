Welcome to my website and my first blog post! I'll be documenting life highlights
here on a semi-regular basis. This upcoming Monday is my first day back in school.
I'm studying computer science and have been really looking forward to it for months!
The first classes are covering assembly and C++. 

I am looking forward to sharing along the way!
